# Twitter redesign with Ruby on Rails

> This project provides a social media website created with Ruby on Rails. I tried to implement a twitter redesign that shows the MVC applied to it, so the user will find that he/she can log in, create a post, follow someone or stop doing it, and even edit profile and cover picture.

> The goal of this project was to apply MVC configuration, Forms, Active Record, Associations, Session, Cookies and Authentication, Callbacks and more.

> Unit tests and Integration test were added as well (RSpec/Capybara/Shoulda).

> Deployment implemented with Heroku.
